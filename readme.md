uBN2rBN
=======

This is a bookmarklet that will convert Bengali text written in the usual
Unicode Eastern nagari script (which we like to call uBN, or Unicode Bengali)
to a romanized version following a "standard" we like to call Romaji-Bangla
(or rBN), instead of the official IAST standard.

Should be simple enough, discounting certain features that are on the wishlist.

More TBW later.
